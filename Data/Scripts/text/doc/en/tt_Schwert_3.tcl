textwin print "The broadsword is a long and demanding weapon, created for dwarfs who prefer reach and precision over sheer mass. Its extended blade allows powerful, sweeping strikes, but it rewards only those who have enough discipline to control it properly. In the hands of a skilled fighter, the broadsword becomes a remarkably persuasive argument, especially for opponents who believe they can keep a safe distance."
