textwin print "The machete is a remarkably elegant weapon for a dwarf. Its balanced weight and clean shape allow for precise, controlled strikes that look almost graceful, at least by dwarven standards. It may not be the largest blade on the battlefield, but in skilled hands it delivers efficient results with impressive accuracy. Enemies often notice this elegance only once, and usually far too late."
