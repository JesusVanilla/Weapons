Enormous, weighty, and undeniably final in its purpose, it demands unwavering strength and absolute control from its wielder. Only the most seasoned warriors can manage a weapon of such magnitude, and even they treat it with a certain respect. When this axe descends, hesitation disappears, doubts vanish, and battles tend to reach their conclusion much sooner than expected."
