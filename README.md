# Weapons

Adds more weapons to the tech tree and rebalance some combat items

- This mod is changing the techtree and is not compatible with savegames with another techtree. After installing this mod, please start a new game
- This mod is not compatible with some other mods that also modify the techtree. List of incompatible mods: “Rare Resources”, “StoneDoor” (I hope to resolve this issue in the future)
